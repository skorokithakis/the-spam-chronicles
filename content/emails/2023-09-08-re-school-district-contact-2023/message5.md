Hi Chloe,

Thank you for your prompt response and for providing the Purchase Order. I have reviewed the document, and everything looks fine. I am happy to give my approval for the project to proceed.

However, it seems that I am again experiencing some technical difficulties with accessing the website link you provided for payment processing. Whenever I try to access the link, an error message appears, indicating that the page cannot be displayed. I have tried different browsers and devices, but unfortunately, the issue persists.

I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter. Could you please verify the link and ensure that it is correct? Alternatively, you may provide me with the necessary payment details, such as the bank account information or alternative payment methods, so that I can process the payment without any further delays.

I appreciate your understanding and patience with the technical challenges I am facing. Once the payment is successfully processed, I will notify you immediately so that the dual-verification process can be initiated.

Looking forward to your prompt assistance and further guidance.

Best regards,
Stavros
