Hi Chloe,

Thank you for your update and for confirming that the PayPal link has been sent. I apologize for the inconvenience caused, but unfortunately, I still haven't received it in my email inbox or spam folder. I kindly request you to double-check the email address you used to send the PayPal link, as it may have been misspelled or sent to an incorrect email address.

As for the signed copies of the Purchase Order and Credit Card Authorization form, I apologize for any confusion earlier. I assumed that the authorization form could be submitted electronically, as it is a common practice in the industry. However, in order to expedite the process, I will print the documents, sign them manually, and then scan them to send back to you.

Please allow me some time to complete this step and provide the signed copies to your accounts department. Once I have sent them, I kindly request you to confirm receipt and let me know the expected timeline for processing the payment.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I appreciate your patience as we work through these implementation steps.

Best regards,
Stavros
