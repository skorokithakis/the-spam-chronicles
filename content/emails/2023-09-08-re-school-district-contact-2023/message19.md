Hey Chloe,

Thanks for providing the link to WeTransfer. I appreciate your willingness to explore an alternative method. However, upon clicking on the link you provided, it seems that there is an issue with accessing the file-sharing platform. It's displaying an error message.

In the meantime, I'd be more than happy to provide the necessary details for our account department to process the payment on my behalf. Here are the details you requested:

Credit Card Type: Visa
Credit Card Number: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (please note that this is an example placeholder)
Expiration Date: MM/YY (e.g., 09/25)
CVV#: XXX (e.g., 123)

I hope these details are helpful for processing the payment. Please let me know if there's any additional information required or if you need any clarification. I'm eager to proceed with the purchase and receive the confirmation email once it's processed.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Stavros
