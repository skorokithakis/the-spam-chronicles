Hi Chloe,

Thank you for your prompt reply and for confirming the correctness of the payment weblink. I apologize for any confusion caused earlier. I have checked my junk/spam folder thoroughly, but unfortunately, I haven't found the PayPal link you mentioned. It appears that it might not have been delivered to my inbox or spam folder.

To ensure a smooth and timely payment process, I would appreciate it if you could kindly resend the PayPal link to hi@stochastictechnologies.com. Once I receive it, I will make the payment promptly and notify you immediately.

Regarding the Credit Card authorization form, I have reviewed the attachment, and everything seems to be in order. I hereby grant my approval for the payment to be processed by your accounts department. I trust that they will handle the transaction efficiently and provide a confirmation of payment once it is completed.

Thank you for your patience and assistance throughout this process. I remain eager to proceed with the project and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Stavros
