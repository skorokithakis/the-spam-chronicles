Hey Chloe,

Apologies for the inconvenience caused once again. I'm sorry to hear that the attachments didn't come through once more. Let's troubleshoot this issue together and make sure the documents reach you successfully.

To ensure the attachments go through this time, I have re-sent them using a different file format. They are now included in a "ZIP" file. Please let me know once you receive the email and if you are able to unzip the file without any issues.

If, for any reason, you still don't receive the attachments or encounter any difficulties opening the ZIP file, please provide an alternative email address or suggest an alternative method for file transfer. I want to make sure we find a solution and move forward with the necessary processing.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Stavros
