Hi Chloe,

Thank you for your understanding regarding the electronic submission of the signed documents. I apologize for any confusion caused earlier. 

I have now completed the process of printing the Purchase Order and Credit Card Authorization form. I have signed both documents and scanned them to create electronic copies. Please find the attachments of the signed copies included in this email.

Kindly confirm the safe receipt of the attachments, and once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in submitting these documents. 

I appreciate your assistance in processing the payment on my behalf. Please keep me informed regarding the progress and any further steps required from my end.

Thank you for your continued cooperation and support.

Best regards,
Stavros
