Hey Chloe,

I apologize for the continued inconvenience. It's quite peculiar that the attachments are still not coming through. Let's explore an alternative method to ensure their successful delivery.

Instead of sending the attachments via email, I suggest using a file-sharing platform for a more reliable transfer. Could you please provide me with the name of a preferred platform or file-sharing service? That way, I can upload the documents securely and share the download link with you.

Once you let me know your preferred method, I'll proceed with the necessary steps to ensure the attachments reach you promptly.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I appreciate your cooperation in resolving this matter.

Best regards,
Stavros
