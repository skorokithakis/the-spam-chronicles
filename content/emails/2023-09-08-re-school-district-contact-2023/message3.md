Hi Chloe,

Thanks for your email. I'm glad to hear that the project is moving forward.

Regarding the signed copy, I apologize for any confusion, but I seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties with my email. It appears that I may have accidentally deleted the attachment or it got lost in my email inbox. However, I assure you that I have signed the necessary documents and can resend them to you promptly once the technical issue is resolved. In the meantime, I kindly request your patience and understanding.

Regarding the PayPal payment, I have checked my inbox, but unfortunately, I haven't received any email from your accounts department. It's possible that there might be some delay or technical glitch causing the delay in receiving it. Could you kindly resend the PayPal link to hi@stochastictechnologies.com? I'll keep an eye out for it and promptly process the payment once it arrives.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I appreciate your understanding regarding the minor issues I'm encountering. I remain eager to proceed with the dual-verification process and receive the list of contacts.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Stavros
