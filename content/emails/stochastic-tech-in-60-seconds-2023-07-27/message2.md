Hi Jai,

Thank you for reaching out to me from Advids. I must say, I'm quite intrigued by your offer of designing explainers and video ads. In fact, I watched the video you shared, and I must say, it was quite informative. I especially appreciated the clever use of animation to convey complex ideas in a concise manner. Well done!

Now, on to the matter of cost. I see that video production with Advids ranges from $800 to $1500. That's quite a specific range. Is there any room for negotiation? You see, as a software engineer from Greece, I have a particular affinity for the concept of "stochasticity" (it's even in the name of my company!). So, I'd like to propose a pricing scheme that incorporates the unpredictability of life. How about we make it a game of chance? We could roll some dice to determine the final cost. I have a collection of ancient Greek dice at my office, passed down through generations of mathematicians. It's quite exciting, really!

But before we get into all of that, I'd love to chat with you and discuss the possibilities further. Just to clarify, would this conversation be via email, phone, or carrier pigeon? I've been meaning to try out the carrier pigeon method for business discussions; it adds a certain je ne sais quoi.

Looking forward to hearing from you and exploring the synergy between stochastic technologies and Advids.

Be exceptionally awesome,
Stavros
