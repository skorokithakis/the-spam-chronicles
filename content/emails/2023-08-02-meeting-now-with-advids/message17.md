I apologize for the delay in sending the meeting details. I have just rechecked, and it seems that there was an error in the email delivery. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. I will resend the meeting details to you and confirm with my team that they have received them as well.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I will ensure that the meeting details reach you as soon as possible.

Best regards,
