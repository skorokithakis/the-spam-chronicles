Hi Jai,

Thanks for reaching out. I apologize for the delay in responding. I appreciate your patience.

I would like to confirm that I've clicked on the Zoom meeting link you provided. However, I seem to be facing some technical difficulties on my end. It is showing an error message stating that the meeting does not exist or has expired. Could you please double-check the link and provide me with a valid one? I am really looking forward to our meeting.

Thank you for understanding.

Kind regards,
Stavros
