Hi Jai,

Thank you for agreeing to connect via Microsoft Teams. Unfortunately, due to some technical difficulties, I am currently unable to send invitations or share links on that platform. However, I have a workaround that I believe will work.

If you could kindly share your availability, including the date and time you prefer, I will do my best to coordinate with my team and schedule a meeting accordingly. Once we have a confirmed time slot, I will provide you with the necessary dial-in details to join the meeting via phone.

Thank you for your understanding and patience throughout this process. I'm looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,
Stavros
