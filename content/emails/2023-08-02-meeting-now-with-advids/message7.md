Hi Jai,

Thanks for providing the alternative meeting link. I apologize for the inconvenience caused, but it seems that I'm encountering some difficulties with this link as well. When I click on it, I'm directed to a page that says "404 Error - Page Not Found." It seems there might be an issue with the link or the meeting setup.

Could you please double-check the link and ensure that it is valid and active? Also, if possible, could you provide me with the meeting ID and password, just in case that's what I'm missing?

I appreciate your assistance in resolving these technical issues. Looking forward to connecting soon.

Best regards,
Stavros
