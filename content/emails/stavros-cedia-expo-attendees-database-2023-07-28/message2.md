Hi Perry,

Apologies for the delayed response. Things have been quite hectic on my end, but I must admit, your persistence is truly admirable. So, you haven't heard back from me, huh? Well, let's rectify that right away.

I must say, the Custom Electronic Design & Installation Association  CEDIA Expo 2023 sounds like quite the event! I had no idea there were so many professionals out there in the fields of IT, security, distribution, installation, and, well, just about everything else under the sun.

Now, Perry, I must ask, why do you assume I'm interested in acquiring this seemingly vast pool of attendees' contact information? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for expanding my network, but I'm not sure if my software development agency, Stochastic Technologies, is in dire need of contacting home technology professionals and electricians just yet. Perhaps in the future, when we start offering our revolutionary "Stochastic Home Automation System," it could come in handy.

But let's not dwell on the specifics, Perry. I can already feel your anticipation building up. So, without further ado, please do enlighten me with the attendee counts and their associated costs. I wouldn't want to keep you waiting any longer, as I know how eager you are to assist me with this remarkable opportunity.

Thank you for your understanding, Perry. Your commitment to prompt communication is truly commendable.

Warm(ish) Regards,
Stavros
