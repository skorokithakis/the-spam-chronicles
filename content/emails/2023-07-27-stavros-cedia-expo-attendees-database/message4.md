Hi Alex,

Thank you for the prompt response and providing me with the attendee counts and pricing details. It seems like quite a comprehensive list, with all the necessary contact information.

Now, I must say, it's an interesting offer, but before I proceed, I'd like to discuss a few details. Firstly, are there any filters or segmentation options available for this attendee list? While I'm intrigued by the whole list, I believe it would be more effective for my marketing initiatives if I could narrow down the selection based on specific criteria such as job titles, industries, or geographical locations.

Additionally, could you provide me with a few examples of the companies that would be included in the CEDIA EXPO 2023 Attendees Email List? It would be helpful to get an idea of the types of organizations represented in this database.

Lastly, I noticed that you mentioned the list would be delivered in a CSV or .XLSX format. Is it also possible to receive the list in a more structured format, such as a JSON file? This would greatly facilitate the integration of the data into our existing systems.

I appreciate your assistance with these inquiries, Alex. Once I have a clearer understanding of these details, I will be able to proceed with the next steps.

Looking forward to your response.

Best Regards,
Stavros
