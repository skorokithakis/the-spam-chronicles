Hi Alex,

Apologies for the confusion caused in my previous email. It seems that I didn't clearly express my inquiries. Let me provide more clarity on the matter.

Regarding the attendee list, I was wondering if there is a way to apply filters or segmentation options to narrow down the contacts based on specific criteria such as job titles, industries, or geographical locations. This would greatly enhance the effectiveness of our marketing efforts by allowing us to target a more specific audience.

Furthermore, I appreciate the random samples you provided, but I'm also interested in seeing a few examples of the companies included in the CEDIA EXPO 2023 Attendees Email List. This information would give me a better understanding of the types of organizations represented in the list and help evaluate its relevance to our business objectives.

Lastly, while CSV and XLSX are common file formats, I was wondering if it's possible to receive the list in a structured format such as JSON. This would facilitate the integration process into our existing systems, saving us valuable time and effort.

Thank you for your attention to these details, Alex. I look forward to your response and further information that will enable us to make an informed decision.

Best Regards,
Stavros
