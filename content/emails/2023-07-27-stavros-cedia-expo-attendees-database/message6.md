Hi Alex,

Apologies for any confusion caused, but I believe there may have been a misunderstanding in my previous email. I was actually inquiring about the possibility of applying filters or segmentation options to the attendee list, not the pricing aspect.

To clarify, I'm interested in knowing if there is a way to refine the list based on specific criteria such as job titles, industries, or geographical locations. This would allow me to target my marketing efforts more effectively and ensure that the contacts I receive align with our specific requirements.

Also, thank you for providing a few random samples of the list format. However, I was wondering if you could share a few examples of the companies included in the CEDIA EXPO 2023 Attendees Email List. Getting a glimpse of the types of organizations represented would help me better evaluate the relevance of this list for our business.

Lastly, I understand that the list is available in CSV or .XLSX format. While those are common file formats, I was wondering if it's also possible to receive the list in a structured format like JSON. This would streamline the integration process into our existing systems, saving us valuable time and effort.

Thank you for your attention to these details, Alex. Your assistance is greatly appreciated as I consider the next steps for our marketing initiatives.

Best Regards,
Stavros
