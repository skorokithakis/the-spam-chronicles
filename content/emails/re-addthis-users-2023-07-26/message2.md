Hi Susan,

Thank you for reaching out to me. I apologize for the delay in my response. I indeed received your previous email and I appreciate your follow-up.

The prospect of obtaining the users list of "AddThis Users" is quite intriguing. As the founder of Stochastic Technologies, I am always interested in exploring new opportunities for collaboration and growth. Having access to a comprehensive data set, including company names, contact names, email addresses, and phone numbers, could potentially open up various possibilities for expanding our network and establishing valuable connections.

I would be delighted to review a sample file of the users list. It would allow me to better understand the quality and relevance of the data you are offering. Truly, I believe there might be great potential in this endeavor. Kindly provide me with the sample file, and I will examine it thoroughly.

Once again, I appreciate your persistence in reaching out to me. Rest assured, I am genuinely interested and eager to explore this opportunity further.

Best regards,

Stavros
Founder, Stochastic Technologies
