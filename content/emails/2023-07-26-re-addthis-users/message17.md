Hi Stavros,

The baseless accusations you make are pointless. As I see you had replied to Susan Ramos about the requirement for a marketing list of contacts, and we as a marketing and campaign service provider look forward to clients who might be interested in increasing the lead pipeline with an easy to access/afford list of contacts.

The accusation about us being spammer, is a little too presumptions from your part. While I understand your frustration, we are NOT an agency that does SPAM, and we do not make any false promises.

I am open getting on a call with you and clear any doubts you have about the list we provide; in fact I am open to sending you a few contacts as sample to review. 

While I understand your frustration, my only request/ask is for you to stop wasting the time and energy of hardworking employees, who struggle to reach their numbers day in-out. While you sit in your cozy cabin writing long emails thinking you are wasting their time, I wonder if you need some kind of help. 

Get well!
Regards
Joe
