Hello Govind,

Thank you for your prompt response. I have prepared the article that promotes my product, and I am excited to share it with you.

However, I seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties in sending the article through email. It appears that there may be a temporary issue with my email provider or internet connection. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Could you please provide me with an alternative method to send you the article? Perhaps a file-sharing platform or any other preferred method you have in mind. I want to ensure that you receive the article promptly and without any further delays.

Thank you for your understanding, Govind. I look forward to your guidance on how we can proceed with sharing the article.

Best regards,

Stavros
