Hi John,

Thanks for reaching out! I appreciate you taking the time to browse my website, stavros.io. It's always good to hear feedback from professionals like yourself.

I understand that you've noticed some issues on my website that might be affecting its traffic and sales. I definitely want to improve its visibility and maximize its potential, so I'm curious to know more about the specific issues you've identified.

Could you please provide further details on the Search Engine Guidelines - 2023 that my website doesn't follow? It would be great if you could also outline the potential solutions you have in mind to fix these issues.

Additionally, I'd be interested in learning more about the competitive rate you mentioned. Could you please share some information about your pricing structure?

Please feel free to send over the detailed proposal at your earliest convenience. I look forward to reviewing it and discussing further steps to enhance my website's performance.

Have a great day!

Best regards,
Stavros
