Hi Jai,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm glad you appreciated our feedback on your process and capabilities videos. I must say, they were quite impressive!

I checked out your website, and it seems like you have a talented team in Pune, India. I'm definitely interested in exploring the possibility of creating a video for my software development services.

Your video creation process seems straightforward, and I appreciate that. It's great to know that your team takes care of everything from conceptualizing to final delivery.

Regarding the price range, I understand that the actual cost depends on the visual style and duration of the video. The samples and costs you shared were helpful in understanding the pricing structure. The quality of your work in those samples was exceptional.

Before we move forward, I have a few questions. Are there any constraints in terms of the video content or format? Additionally, can you provide more information on the customization options available? It would be great to have a clear understanding of what can be achieved.

I would like to explore ideas and communication objectives further. A 30-minute call next week sounds perfect. Could you please suggest a few available time slots, and I'll confirm the most convenient one for me?

Looking forward to discussing this exciting opportunity with you!

Best regards,
Stavros
