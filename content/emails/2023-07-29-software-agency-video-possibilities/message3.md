Hi Stavros,
I appreciate all the feedback on our work and our process, definitely helps
us keep a check on client satisfaction.

To answer your questions, our entire process is built in a way that it's
extremely customisable.
At every stage of production, you'd have full control over what is being
created and how it is being done, communication for the same with your team
is frequent as well.

We do not put restrictions on the number of feedbacks/iterations you can
give, so it really is open domain for you to work with.

I'm available this week between, 9 AM - 1 PM EST on Tuesday and Wednesday,
Let me know what time works for you, happy to send the invite.

Looking forward to speaking with you soon!
