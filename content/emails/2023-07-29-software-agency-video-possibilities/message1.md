Hi Stavros,

Thank you for all your kind words.
I am glad you liked our process & capabilities videos.

Now let me clear out all of your concerns one by one.
We are based in Pune, India. You can check us out - Here
<https://advids.co/>

Our video creation process <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ft5XdHLEU> is
very straightforward. First, we have a quick chat to understand your
vision/ objectives.
Based on that, our team will take care of all assets & production stages
for you i.e. conceptualizing everything from scratch to final delivery.

The price of USD 800-1500 you saw is just an estimated range.
The precise cost is finalized on the basis of the visual style & duration
of the video.

Sharing some samples & costs for reference to help you understand how we
can help you present your software development services -

   - Sample <https://vimeo.com/458686687> - USD 1500 for a 60-sec 2D video
   - Sample <https://vimeo.com/764066806/b65554817f> - USD 1100 for a
   60-sec 2D+Stock video
   - Sample <https://vimeo.com/521727343/85dbf934a9> - USD 1000 for a
   60-sec UI/UX video

I hope this clears your doubts. Feel free to ask in case you still have any.

We can discuss ideas, communication objectives and what all can be created.
Can we connect anytime next week for a 30-minute call?
