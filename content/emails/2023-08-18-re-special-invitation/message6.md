Hi Chuck,

Thank you for providing me with the available time slots. I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that those dates and times won't work for me. Unfortunately, I have prior commitments during those periods.

I understand that calling you directly could help bypass the scheduling difficulties we've been facing. However, I'm currently experiencing some issues with my phone line, and I'm unable to make outgoing calls at the moment. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In order to streamline the scheduling process, is there an alternative method we can explore? For example, if you have any slots available on a different scheduling platform or through email, I can certainly accommodate those.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Best regards,
Steve
