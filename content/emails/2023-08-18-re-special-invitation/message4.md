Hi Chuck,

Thank you for providing an alternative link. I appreciate your prompt response. Unfortunately, I'm still encountering the same technical difficulties with the new link you provided. It seems that there may be some issue on the booking platform's end.

To ensure that we can connect for our discussion, would it be possible for us to schedule the Zoom meeting manually? If you could provide me with a few available time slots, I will try my best to accommodate them on my end. Alternatively, if there's a different platform that you prefer using for scheduling appointments, please let me know and I'll be happy to work with that too.

Looking forward to resolving this issue and connecting with you soon.

Best regards,
Steve
