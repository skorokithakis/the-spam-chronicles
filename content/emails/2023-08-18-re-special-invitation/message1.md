Steve, my invitation to interview with me for my new book is still open. You will get a lot out of our discussion. Anything you learn and find useful is yours to keep and implement for your own business. 
Will you spend 45 minutes with me? 

Please find a slot on our calendars for a Zoom meeting using this link: https://calendly.com/chuck-601/book-interview  

Thank you Steve; I look forward to spending some time with you.

Chuck

I am authoring my second book demonstrating that the principles and strategies from my first book still work in our post COVID, inflation-ridden world. I would interview you for about 45 minutes, show you the exact strategies and ask “What is your opinion? What revenue impact would these strategies have for businesses in your industry?”
