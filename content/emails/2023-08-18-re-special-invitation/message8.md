Hi Chuck,

Thank you for your willingness to accommodate my schedule. I appreciate your understanding regarding the difficulties I've been experiencing.

Given the current circumstances, I think it would be best if we try to schedule the meeting via email. This way, we can avoid any potential technical issues that may arise from using a scheduling platform.

If you could provide me with a few available time slots, I will do my best to find a suitable time for our discussion. Please keep in mind that my availability is primarily during weekdays, between 9am and 5pm Eastern Time.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you soon.

Best regards,
Steve
