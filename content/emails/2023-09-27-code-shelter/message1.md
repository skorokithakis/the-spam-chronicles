Hi there!

Shri here from [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app/). Came across Code Shelterâ€”looks
interesting! We're a startup accelerator for founders in the earliest stages
of building their companies, so I'm always on the lookout for promising
products.

A bit about us: we've funded 300+ founders in 50 countries who've gone on to
raise over $200M. We make $20k investments, run a 3-month remote accelerator
program, host our founders in San Francisco for a month, and much more.

I think you might be a good fit for Pioneer. If you're interested, here's a
link to [fast-track your
application](https://pioneer.app/apply?referralCode=f4b0cbdb807fa1bd3a2855adc627de97).
Let me know if you have any questions!

Shri  
Investor, Pioneer
