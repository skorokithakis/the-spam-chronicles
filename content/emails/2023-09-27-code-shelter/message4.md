Hey Shri,

Thanks for getting back to me and sharing those links! I took a deep dive into the Pioneer website, checked out the FAQ, and even went through the blog post about the most recent cohort. It all looks quite promising!

I have to say, I'm really impressed by the diversity of the companies in your cohorts. It seems like you support a wide range of industries and ideas, which is fantastic. It gives me hope that Stochastic Technologies could find its place in the Pioneer community.

One thing that caught my attention while reading the FAQ was the mention of mentorship. Could you tell me a bit more about the mentors in the program? How do they assist the founders and what kind of expertise do they bring to the table?

Thanks again, Shri! Your responses are really helpful in giving me a better understanding of Pioneer.

Cheers,
Stavros
