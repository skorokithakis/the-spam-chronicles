Hello Lisa,

Thank you for providing the PayPal email address. I appreciate your assistance in moving forward with the payment process.

Regarding the order sheet, I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there might be some technical glitch preventing the updated version from reflecting on your end. To ensure we are on the same page, I will go ahead and send you the updated version directly via email.

I will attach the updated order sheet along with any additional changes and notes I have made. Please let me know once you have received it, and if there are any further clarifications or adjustments needed.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we sort out this issue. I am committed to providing you with accurate and up-to-date information.

Looking forward to your reply and resolving this matter promptly.

Best regards,
Stavros
