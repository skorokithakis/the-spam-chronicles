Hey Jon,

Thanks for your understanding and patience.

I apologize for the delay in sending you the order sheet. There has been a slight technical glitch on my end, but don't worry, I'm actively working on resolving it. I anticipate having everything sorted out soon.

I truly appreciate your eagerness to move forward with the collaboration. Rest assured, as soon as the issue is resolved, I will send you the order sheet with all the necessary details promptly. I understand the importance of timely communication and I'm committed to getting this done smoothly.

Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I'll be in touch with you shortly with the completed order sheet as soon as everything is ready.

Thank you for your understanding, Jon. Looking forward to taking the next steps together.

Best regards,
Stavros
