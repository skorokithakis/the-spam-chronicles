Hello Lisa,

Thank you for your message and for providing the alternative link and attachments.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous technical issue. I have now successfully accessed the Excel sheet and the order sheet. Thank you for sharing them.

I will review the websites and the order sheet thoroughly to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the requirements and can provide you with the necessary information and updates.

Regarding the payment, I appreciate your flexibility in accepting PayPal. This payment method works perfectly fine for me, and I will proceed with the payment through PayPal as soon as we have finalized all the details.

Once I have reviewed the sheets, I will reach out to you with any further questions or clarifications. Thank you for your patience and cooperation in resolving the previous difficulties.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,
Stavros
