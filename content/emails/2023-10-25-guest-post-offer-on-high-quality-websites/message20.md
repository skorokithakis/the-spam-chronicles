Hello Jon,

Thank you for sharing the order sheet with me. However, I regret to inform you that I am currently experiencing some difficulties accessing the link you provided. It seems that there might be an issue with the permissions or the link itself. I have tried different browsers and devices, but unfortunately, I still cannot access or edit the sheet.

To proceed smoothly, could you please double-check the sharing settings of the Google Sheet and make sure it is set to be accessible by anyone with the link? Alternatively, if there is another method by which you can share the necessary details with me, I would be more than happy to explore that option as well.

Regarding the payment method, while I understand your preference for crypto, I am more comfortable with PayPal. Therefore, I kindly request that we proceed with the payment through PayPal, if that is acceptable to you.

Once we have resolved the technical issue with accessing the order sheet and confirmed the payment details, we can progress smoothly with our collaboration.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt response and resolving these minor inconveniences.

Best regards,
Stavros
