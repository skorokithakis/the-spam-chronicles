Hey Lisa,

Thanks for your response and offering the 7% discount on the total. That sounds reasonable to me, and I appreciate your willingness to accommodate the collaboration.

I'm glad you liked the suggestion for the article topic on the importance of software security in today's digital landscape. Writing the article within 48 hours on that topic sounds great. As for the link, I would like it to be a Do-Follow link. It would be fantastic if you could ensure that.

Regarding the details, I understand the need for organization and clarity. Creating a sheet where we can add all the necessary information including website details, anchor text, and the link sounds like a practical approach. I will create a sheet and share it with you shortly. Feel free to add the required information to ensure everything is in order.

Once we have everything in place and all the details are added to the sheet, we can proceed with the next steps and finalize the collaboration.

Thank you once again for your cooperation, Lisa. I look forward to completing the remaining tasks and moving ahead with this opportunity.

Best regards,
Stavros
