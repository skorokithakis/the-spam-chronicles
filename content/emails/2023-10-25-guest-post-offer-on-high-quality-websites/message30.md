Hello Jon,

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your understanding.

I want to assure you that I am currently working on updating the sheet as we speak. Once the changes have been made, I will promptly notify you and provide the updated version of the order sheet.

Please keep a lookout on your inbox for the updated version, as it will contain all the necessary information and any additional notes or adjustments that were discussed.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. If you have any further questions or require any additional assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Best regards,
Stavros
