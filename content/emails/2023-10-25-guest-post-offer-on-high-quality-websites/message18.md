Hello Jon,

Thank you for your prompt response and for sharing the additional information. I appreciate your efficiency in moving forward.

Regarding the Google Sheets, I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience, but it appears that I am currently experiencing some technical difficulties accessing the added sheet. I have checked my settings and made sure I am signed in, but unfortunately, I am still unable to view or edit the sheet.

Could you please double-check the sharing settings of the Google Sheet? It's possible that there might be a small issue there. Once you've verified and adjusted the settings, please let me know so that I can try accessing the sheet again.

As for the payment, I have a couple of preferred payment methods. Could you please let me know if you accept PayPal or if there is another payment method you prefer? This will allow me to proceed with the payment promptly.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I look forward to your response and resolving these minor technicalities so that we can smoothly proceed with our collaboration.

Best regards,
Stavros
