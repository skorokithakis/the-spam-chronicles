Hey Jon,

Thanks for your prompt response and providing the details.

Sure, I can provide you with the details for the article. Let's focus on a topic that would be relevant to my website and services. How about we go with an article that explores the importance of software security in today's digital landscape? We can discuss the potential subtopics and key points that should be covered to ensure the article is informative and engaging for my audience.

Regarding the timeline, the 24-48 hour turnaround sounds reasonable. I understand the need for efficiency and I'm confident in your ability to deliver within that time frame.

As for the pricing, $15 per article is within a reasonable range. However, before we finalize this, I would like to propose a small modification. Since we're exploring a potential collaboration where I can also offer backlinks on my website, would it be possible to include a discounted rate for the articles if we proceed with the backlink option as well? It would greatly contribute to the overall value we can provide to our respective audiences.

Once we agree on these terms, I'm ready to move forward with the collaboration and provide you with the necessary details for the article.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the proposed modification and proceeding with the next steps.

Best regards,
Stavros
