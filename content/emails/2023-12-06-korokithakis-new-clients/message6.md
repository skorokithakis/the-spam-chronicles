Hey Jackie,

Thanks for reaching out again. I appreciate your follow-up.

Things are going well on my end, thank you for asking. As for scheduling a Zoom call, unfortunately, I'm still experiencing some technical difficulties with my calendar system. It seems to be an ongoing issue that I've been trying to resolve.

I apologize for the inconvenience it may cause, but could we possibly postpone the Zoom call for now? I assure you, I'm still very interested in exploring how PersistIQ can create a tailored solution for our outbound lead generation and sales campaigns for Korokithakis. I just need a little more time to sort out the technical hiccups.

I'll keep you updated on the calendar situation, and once it's back up and running smoothly, we can set up a call. I appreciate your understanding.

Best,
Stavros
