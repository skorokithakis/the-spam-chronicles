Hi Stavros,

Thanks for getting back to me.

Sure. To give you an idea, here’s how we can do that by using personalized email outreach campaigns:

We build targeted prospects lists based on your Ideal Customer Profile (including demographics, firmographics, pain points, and action triggers)

Our Email Copywriting team create a series of outreach emails with different messaging to test, and measure them to see what performs best

Our Sales Development Reps sends the emails and follows up with prospects to warm them up and book meetings with them on your calendar

I've also attached a PDF file that you can review and get a better understanding of what it is that we specialize here in PersistIQ. 

Our portfolio is filled with successful case studies and references from past clients who are more than happy to share their experiences with us. Here's a link to some of the most recent ones: https://www.persistiq.com/customers

Also, regarding your last 2 questions- we work closely with you to best understand your unique value propositions and selling points within your given market and we have an in-house copywriting team that writes a highly specific and target email to all of the potential customers on your behalf. All the copywriting will be finalized and approved by you or your team before we launch any campaigns. 

I’d be happy to show you some examples in a brief call. Are you available this week for a quick chat?

Best,

Jackie Baker
