Hey Dan,

Tuesday or Wednesday at 4 PM works for me, but I just realized that I didn't ask you which time zone you're in. It would be helpful to know so that we can sync up our schedules properly. Can you please let me know your time zone so we can schedule the call accordingly? Looking forward to our discussion!

Cheers,

Stavros
