Hey Dan,

I understand the time difference can be a bit tricky, but unfortunately, 7 PM won't work for me either. I have a prior commitment in the evening. Is there any chance we can find a time during the afternoon that would work for both of us? Maybe around 3 PM or 4 PM? Let me know your thoughts and we can try to find a time that suits both our schedules.

Thanks again for your patience,

Stavros
