Hey Dan,

Thanks for the reminder and the link. I've just clicked on it and it seems there might be an issue on your end. It's showing an error message saying, "The room does not exist or has been closed." Could you please double-check the link and make sure everything is set up correctly? I'll be waiting for your update.

Thanks,

Stavros
