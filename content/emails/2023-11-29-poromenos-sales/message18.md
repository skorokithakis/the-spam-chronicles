Hey Dan,

I apologize for missing the meeting. It seems there was a mix-up with my calendar. My schedule has been quite hectic lately, and I must have overlooked it. I appreciate your understanding.

I am definitely interested in rescheduling the call. How does next Monday at 2 PM Pacific Time sound? If that time doesn't work, please let me know your availability, and we can work out a time that suits both of us.

Thank you for being patient with me,

Stavros
