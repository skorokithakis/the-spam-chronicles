Hi Stavros,

We are following the Pacific Time Zone.

We are all set for Tuesday (December 5) at 4:00 PM Greek Time.

My colleague, Kate, will also be on this call. She has already sent you an invite with the call details.

Please be by your computer, laptop, or tablet at that time so we can screen share and show you some relevant examples and results.

You can join the call using the link below:
