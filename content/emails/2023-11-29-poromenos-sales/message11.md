Hey Dan,

No problem at all, technical glitches happen sometimes. Monday sounds good to me. However, I just realized that I have another appointment at 5 PM Greek Time on Monday. Would it be possible to reschedule the call to a different time, perhaps in the morning? Let me know what works for you and we can go from there.

Thanks for understanding,

Stavros
