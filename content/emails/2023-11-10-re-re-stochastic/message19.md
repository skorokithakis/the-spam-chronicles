Heidi,

Thank you for your follow-up. I apologize for the delay in processing the payment. I have forwarded the invoice to our accounting department, and they are currently handling the transfer.

I understand your need to verify the payment with your accounting department. As soon as I receive the proof of payment from our team, I will forward it to you without any further delay. I assure you that I am closely monitoring the situation to ensure a swift resolution.

I appreciate your patience and understanding throughout this process.

Best regards,
Stavros
