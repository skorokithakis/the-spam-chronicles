Heidi,

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize for the delay in providing you with the payment information.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a minor issue with our accounting department's system, which is causing a delay in processing payments. I have just been informed that they are working diligently to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. I understand how important it is for you to have the payment information, and I assure you that I am doing everything I can to expedite the process.

I kindly request your patience and assure you that I will provide you with the payment information as soon as it becomes available. Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Stavros
