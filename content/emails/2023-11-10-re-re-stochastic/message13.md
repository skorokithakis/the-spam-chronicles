Dear Stavros,

According to the rules of dispute domain name registration, the minimum length of registration is 5 years. After the registration, the validity term of the certificate authenticated by the Chinese Government is also 5 years. First, we help you register the names for the future 5 years at a time instead of annually. Due to the application from the third party, the minimum length of registration should be 5 years. After the registration, we will link these domains to your website and send you the certificate. Hope my explanation will make you understand. If you confirm the 5 years registration period, we can send you the invoice for payment. The total regisrtation fee would be 4025USD. Thanks!

Best Regards, 
Heidi Zong
