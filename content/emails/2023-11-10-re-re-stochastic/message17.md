Heidi,

Thank you for providing the invoice. I have carefully reviewed it, and everything appears to be in order.

To proceed with the payment, I will forward the invoice to our accounting department. Once the payment has been transferred, I will notify you and provide the proof of payment as requested.

I appreciate your prompt assistance in this matter and look forward to the successful completion of the domain name registration.

Best regards,
Stavros
