Heidi,

Thanks for reaching out to me. I appreciate you informing me about this domain name registration issue. As the founder of Stochastic Technologies, it's important for me to assess the situation and make an informed decision.

I can see that the company in question has applied for a number of domain names, including stochastic.asia, stochastic.in, stochastic.co.in, and many others. It's clear that the domain names registration is open-wide, and I understand that they have the right to apply for available names.

In order to determine whether these names are of importance to my business or interest, I would like to know more details about their intentions and plans for these domains. Can you kindly provide additional information about the purpose behind their registration? This will help me make an informed decision regarding whether to register these names or not.

I kindly request you to provide these details as soon as possible so that I can handle this issue properly. Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Stavros
