Heidi,

Thank you for providing the procedure for registering the domain names and the price list. I appreciate your assistance in helping me protect the intellectual property rights of Stochastic Technologies.

I have carefully reviewed the price list and I'm ready to proceed with the registration. Please find attached the completed Dispute Application Form. I have filled it out with the necessary information.

Regarding the payment, I would like to clarify a few details. Could you kindly provide me with the specific bank information, such as the bank name, account number, and any other required details? This will ensure that I can make the payment accurately and without any issues.

Once I receive the bank information from you, I will proceed with the payment and send you the payment proof as requested. I want to ensure there are no delays in the registration process, so your prompt response with the bank details would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you again for your cooperation and support in this matter.

Best regards,
Stavros

Dispute Application Form is attached.
