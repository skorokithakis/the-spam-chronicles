Heidi,

I appreciate your follow-up on the payment information. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience caused by the delay in confirming the payment.

Upon receiving your message, I immediately contacted our accounting department to ensure a prompt resolution. I have been informed that they are currently experiencing technical difficulties with their systems, which have caused delays in processing payments.

I completely understand the importance of confirming the payment before the deadline. Rest assured, I am personally monitoring the situation and working closely with our accounting department to expedite the process. I kindly ask for your understanding and continued patience as we strive to resolve this matter as soon as possible.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Stavros
