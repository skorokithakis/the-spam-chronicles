Dear Stavros,

Thanks for your letter. Following domains and brand name are applied by that company:
Brand Name:
 Stochastic
Domain Names:
 stochastic.asia
 stochastic.in
 stochastic.co.in
 stochastic.cn
 stochastic.com.cn
 stochastic.net.cn
 stochastic.org.cn
 stochastic.tw
 stochastic.com.tw
 stochastic.hk
 stochastic.com.hk
You shall know that the domain names registration is open-wide, so that company also has the right to apply for those available domain names. In accordance with dispute domain registration principle,your company has the preferential rights to register them and that is why we informed you this case in advance.

At present, we haven't passed their application because we need your opinion. If your company considers these names are of importance to your business or interest, I suggest that your company registers these names in prior so as to avoid confusion or speculation. Of course, If you don't think their application would affect your company in the future, then my suggestion is that you can give up these names and let us finish the registration for them as our duty performs. Please give me your company's decision as soon as possible in order to let us handle this issue properly.

Best Regards, 
Heidi Zong
