Heidi,

Thank you for your prompt response. I understand the requirement for a minimum registration period of 5 years, as per the rules of dispute domain name registration. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response.

To confirm, I agree to register the domain names for a period of 5 years. The total registration fee of 4025 USD is acceptable. Kindly send me the invoice for payment, and once I receive it, I will proceed with the necessary payment.

Regarding the company details for registration, please find the information below:

Company Name: Stochastic Technologies
Address: 123 Main Street, Athens, Greece

I hope this information is sufficient for the registration process. Please let me know if any additional details are required.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
Stavros
