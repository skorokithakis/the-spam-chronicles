Hello Oliver,

Thank you for your enthusiasm and willingness to write an original article for my website. I truly appreciate your dedication to enhancing your writing skills and expanding your online presence. It's great to see someone passionate about their work.

Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few things. Firstly, could you please provide me with a brief overview of the specific topic you have in mind for the article? I want to make sure it aligns with the interests and needs of my website's audience.

Additionally, it would be very helpful if you could share a writing sample with me. This will give me a better understanding of your writing style and ensure that it resonates with my readers. If you have a specific format or guidelines in mind for writing the article, please let me know as well.

Once I have these details from you, I can evaluate whether the proposed topic and style are a good fit for my website. If everything aligns well, I will be more than happy to proceed with publishing your article.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Stavros
