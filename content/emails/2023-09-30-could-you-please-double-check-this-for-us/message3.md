I created my website as a means to enhance my writing and it's also where I
post some of my work. You can check it out at disastersafety.info. My
favorite topics are what you see on my site but I'm very much open to
expanding my horizons.

At this time, I was hoping to write an original article for your website. This
is free of charge should you decide to go ahead and publish it on your site.

My only goal is to gain more writing experience and to widen my online
presence. I will send you a digital copy (attach or copy on the email
whichever works for you) and from there you get to review it and let me
know if you need me to revise anything.

I'm excited to write for your site and happy to craft this to your
specifications, so please let me know what requirements or guidelines I
should keep in mind as far as writing for your website. All I need is a
quick note from you and I can get started!

Best,
Oliver Lambert
