Hey Jack,

Apologies for the delay in my response. I appreciate your patience.

I have reviewed the domains sheet you provided, and I'm ready to proceed with selecting the relevant domains for backlinking opportunities. However, before I make my selections, I wanted to confirm a few details regarding the targeted anchor text and URLs.

Could you please clarify if you have any specific requirements or preferences for the anchor text? Additionally, it would be helpful if you could provide me with the URLs you would like the backlinks to point to.

Once I have these details from you, I will carefully select the domains that align with my website and objectives, and share the information with you promptly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I'm looking forward to receiving the additional information from you.

Best regards,
Stavros
