*Hi Stavros,*

No problem at all, and thank you for getting back to me. I appreciate your
thoroughness in this process.

In terms of anchor text, I would like to focus on using natural and
contextually relevant phrases that best fit the content of the linking
pages. However, I don't have any specific requirements at the moment.
Please feel free to use your expertise to choose suitable anchor text.

*As for the URLs, I'd like the backlinks to point to the following pages on
our website:*

*[https://techktimes.com/
<https://techktimes.com/>][https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/
<https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/>][https://publicistpaper.com/
<https://publicistpaper.com/>]*
*[https://www.techmagazines.net/ <https://www.techmagazines.net/>]*
*[https://www.trendingbird.com/ <https://www.trendingbird.com/>]*
*[https://www.techycomp.com/ <https://www.techycomp.com/>]*

Please ensure that the selected domains are of high quality and relevance
to our niche. I trust your judgment in this regard.

Once you have everything in place, please let me know, and we can proceed
with the next steps. Thanks again for your assistance, Stavros.

*Best regards,Jack*
