Hey Jack,

Thanks for your prompt response and for attaching the sheet with the domains for backlinking opportunities. I really appreciate your quick action and the convenience of having the sheet readily available.

I've just accessed the sheet you provided, and it seems to be working fine. However, I'm encountering a small issue when trying to make my selections. It appears that the sheet is currently view-only, and I'm unable to edit or make any changes to it.

I apologize for the inconvenience, but would it be possible for you to grant me edit access to the sheet? That way, I can proceed with selecting the domains that align with my goals and move forward with the next steps of the process smoothly.

Thank you for your kind cooperation and understanding. Once I have the necessary edit access, I'll be able to complete my selections promptly.

Looking forward to your swift assistance, and I appreciate your continued support throughout this collaboration.

Best regards,
Stavros
