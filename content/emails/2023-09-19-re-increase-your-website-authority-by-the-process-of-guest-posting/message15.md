Hey Jack,

Thank you for providing the updated access to edit the sheet. I really appreciate your quick response and resolving the issue promptly.

I've accessed the sheet using the link you shared, and I can confirm that I now have the necessary edit access. I apologize for any inconvenience caused earlier, and I'm glad we were able to overcome that obstacle.

Now that I have the ability to make changes, I will review the domains for backlinking opportunities and select the ones that align with my goals. I'll make sure to do this as soon as possible and get back to you with my selections.

Once again, thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I'm grateful for your assistance throughout this process, and I'm looking forward to progressing further toward achieving the desired outcomes.

Best regards,
Stavros
