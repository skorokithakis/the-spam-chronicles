Hey Jack,

Apologies if I gave the impression that I haven't read our previous emails thoroughly. I did go through them, and I appreciate the information you provided so far.

I understand that you've explained the process and shared valuable insights. However, I wanted to be sure that I fully comprehend the details before moving forward. I believe it's essential to have a clear understanding of the strategy and its execution to achieve the desired outcomes.

Based on the previous emails, I assume you have prepared a sheet with domains for backlinking opportunities. I apologize if I missed that information earlier. I would appreciate it if you could resend the sheet, as I don't seem to have it in my inbox. Once I have the sheet in hand, I'll be able to select the domains and proceed accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding and for providing the necessary resources to move forward with the backlinking process.

Best regards,
Stavros
