Hi Stavros,

 

Thanks a lot for your email! I’m Zoë, Senior Project Manager at Verboo, and I work closely with Martin and Cheryl. It’s great to be in touch with you and we’re really happy to hear that you’re interested in our services.

 

We would love to have a call with you to discuss how we can use AI in conjunction with our human linguists to provide you with high quality translation at a competitive price.

 

Would you be free at the start of next week for a call? Please let us know when would suit you best and we can organise a time.

 

In the meantime, please find our one sheet attached, which gives an overview of our language services. As you can see from this, in addition to translation, we also offer subtitling, voiceover, DTP and graphics localisation, to name a few. We would love to take you through these on the call too.

 

Wishing you a lovely evening ahead,
Zoë
