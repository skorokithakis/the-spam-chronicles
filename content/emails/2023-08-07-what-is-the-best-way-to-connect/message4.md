Hi Jai,

Thank you for your prompt reply. I apologize for any confusion that may have arisen.

A video call sounds great! I appreciate your flexibility regarding the scheduling. I would prefer to have the call early next week to allow enough time for preparation.

Please go ahead and set up the Zoom meeting for us. Any time from Monday to Wednesday would work well for me. Kindly provide me with the meeting details, including the date, time, and Zoom link, and I will make sure to add it to my schedule.

Thank you once again, Jai. Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Stavros
