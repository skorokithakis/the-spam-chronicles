Hi Jai,

Thank you for the reminder. I apologize for any inconvenience caused, but I'm afraid I still haven't been able to access the meeting link you provided earlier. I've tried multiple times, but it keeps giving me the same error message.

I understand that our meeting was scheduled for 10:00 AM today, and I sincerely apologize for any delay or confusion caused by this issue. As we continue to work towards resolving it, I kindly request your patience and understanding.

In the meantime, if you have any alternative ways of connecting for our discussion, please let me know. I'm available and ready to proceed with our call as soon as we can overcome this technical difficulty.

Thank you for your cooperation, Jai. I appreciate your flexibility and I'm really looking forward to our conversation.

Best regards,
Stavros
