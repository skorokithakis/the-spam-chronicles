Hi Jai,

Thank you for providing the meeting details. I appreciate your effort in setting it up.

However, I seem to be having some trouble accessing the meeting link you shared. I've tried opening it, but it keeps giving me an error message. I'm not sure if it's an issue on my end or if there's something wrong with the link. Could you please double-check and ensure that the link is correct?

If there is indeed an issue with the link, perhaps you can generate a new one and resend it to me? Alternatively, if you have any other method of connecting for our discussion, please let me know and we can explore different options.

Thank you for your understanding, Jai. I'm looking forward to our discussion as well.

Best regards,
Stavros
