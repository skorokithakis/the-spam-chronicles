Peter,

I apologize for any confusion that may have arisen from my previous response. Rest assured, I am not utilizing any bots in this process. My intention is to engage in genuine and meaningful negotiations for the domain.

As mentioned before, I am open to exploring the sale of the domain through Dan.com, a reputable platform that can help facilitate the transaction. If your client is willing to provide specific instructions on how they would like to proceed, I am ready to take the necessary steps as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Stavros
