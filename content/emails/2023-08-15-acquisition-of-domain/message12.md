Peter,

Thank you for getting back to me with the updated offer from your client. I understand that they have re-evaluated the value of my domain based on domain tools they have used.

While the offer of $10,000 USD is appreciated, I would like to gain a better understanding of how the costs associated with the sale and transfer of the domain would be split evenly between both parties.

Could you please provide a breakdown of these costs so I can assess their impact on the overall transaction? Additionally, if there are any fees or expenses beyond the sale and transfer costs that I should be aware of, kindly let me know.

Once I have a clear understanding of the costs involved, I will be able to make an informed decision regarding your client's revised offer.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Stavros
