Peter,

Thank you for keeping me informed of your client's response. I understand that their maximum offer falls significantly short of my asking price.

In light of this information, I am open to further negotiation. I would appreciate it if you could relay to your client that I am willing to reconsider my initial asking price. However, before proceeding, I kindly request that they provide me with a revised maximum offer. This will help me gauge the feasibility of reaching a compromise.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

Stavros
