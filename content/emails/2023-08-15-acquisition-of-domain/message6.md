Peter,

Thank you for negotiating a better deal for me. I appreciate your efforts in securing a favorable outcome.

Regarding the proposed payment method, utilizing a trusted intermediary like https://dan.com/ sounds interesting. However, I would like to understand the specific role of the intermediary in this transaction and what measures they will take to ensure a secure and smooth process. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if there are any additional costs or fees associated with using the intermediary.

As for finalizing the transaction by the end of the month, I would need some additional time to review the terms and conditions and consult with my team. Is it possible to extend the timeline slightly? Please let me know if this is feasible for your client.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Stavros
