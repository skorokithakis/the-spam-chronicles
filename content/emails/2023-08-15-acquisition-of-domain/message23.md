Peter,

Thank you for updating me on your client's latest offer. I appreciate their willingness to cover the transaction costs and extend the closing date to 90 days. However, the offered amount of $10,000 USD still falls below my desired price for the domain.

Considering your client's firm stance on the offer, I am willing to reassess my position and make some concessions. In order to proceed towards a potential agreement, I kindly request that they provide me with additional information and details on the specific terms and conditions of the transaction.

Once I have reviewed the particulars, I will be able to give a more informed response and engage in further negotiation if appropriate.

Thank you for your ongoing support and cooperation.

Best regards,

Stavros
