Peter,

Thank you for suggesting the use of Dan.com for the domain sale. I appreciate your advice and will look into setting up an account there as you've recommended. It seems like a reliable platform, and I'm willing to explore any potential avenues that can facilitate the sale process.

Regarding your question about my previous experience with domain sales, yes, I have indeed had successful transactions in the past. I have sold domains through various avenues, including private sales and online marketplaces.

If your client is interested in proceeding with the purchase, I kindly request that they provide further details and instructions on how we can proceed with the transaction through Dan.com. Once we have clarity on that, we can move forward accordingly.

Thank you for your patience and assistance.

Best regards,

Stavros
