Peter,

Thank you for relaying your client's feedback regarding my evaluation for the domain. I understand that they feel the asking price is too high for a three-word domain with a .net extension.

I assure you that my evaluation was conducted diligently, taking various factors into consideration. However, as I mentioned before, I am open to negotiation and finding a middle ground that aligns with both parties' expectations.

In order to proceed with the negotiation, I kindly request that your client provides me with a counteroffer. This will allow me to evaluate their perspective and make the necessary adjustments to the price, if feasible.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

Stavros
