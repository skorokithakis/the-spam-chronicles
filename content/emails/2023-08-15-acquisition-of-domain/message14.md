Peter,

Thank you for your follow-up email. I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Yes, I am interested in selling the domain, but as the owner, I believe it is important to have a clear understanding of all the details and costs involved before finalizing the sale.

I kindly request you to provide me with a breakdown of the precise details and costs associated with this transaction. Once I have a comprehensive understanding of the terms and expenses, I will be able to make an informed decision regarding the sale of the domain.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Stavros
