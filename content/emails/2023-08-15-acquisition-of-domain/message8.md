Peter,

Thank you for providing further clarification on the use of Dan.com as an escrow service and its association with GoDaddy. This helps alleviate some concerns regarding the security and legitimacy of the transaction.

I appreciate your client's flexibility in allowing for a negotiable closing timeline. Given the importance of this decision, I would like to take the necessary time to review all the details and consult with my team.

Could you kindly provide me with a breakdown of any potential fees or charges associated with using Dan.com as the escrow service? This will assist me in evaluating the overall cost involved in the transaction.

Once I have all the information, I will be in a better position to finalize the sale of my domain.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Stavros
