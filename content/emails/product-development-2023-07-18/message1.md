Hey - how's your Tuesday going so far?

I've been doing some research on product developmeny and just found your great article: https://www.stavros.io/posts/making-motorcycle-remote-mount/

As it happens we've been working on a very similar content project and have recently produced content around the same topic.

I wondered if you might be interested in checking it out and if you liked it, perhaps we can find a win-win here and help promote each others content.

For example we could (indirectly) link to your content if you could link to ours.

Let me know if you might be open for something mutually beneficial like this and if so we can talk details.

Thanks!
