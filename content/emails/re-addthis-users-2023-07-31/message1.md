Hi Stavros,

My name is Joe and thank you for getting back to us. 

I have access to contact information from over 120K distinct companies that
utilize AddThis. You may acquire any specific number of contacts filtered
based on your ideal target audience. 

Decision makers: 4-6 contacts per company
Titles: Owner/Founder/MD, C-Suite, VP, Director, Manager from across all
departments. 

Please find attached sample file for review. 

Cost Structure:
We follow a scale-down pricing model, based on the cost per contact you
acquire. The higher the number of records, the lower the cost-per-contact,
and vice versa. Additionally, the pricing varies based on applied filters,
records availability, niche industry verticals, and the number of unique
accounts/companies in the list. 

Pricing Bracket (unlimited use) - Ballpark figure
>2,000 contacts @ $499 at 0.25c per record
>4,000 contacts @ $720 at 0.18c per record
>10,000 contacts @ $1199 at 0.12c per record

You may also acquire a test file of 1K contacts at $149. 

Do let me know if you would be interested in acquiring the list and if you
have any questions. 

Upon confirmation, I can get back with a quote and the terms for review.
