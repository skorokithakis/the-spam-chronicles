Hi Joe,

Thank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your offer sounds quite intriguing. As the founder of Stochastic Technologies, I am always on the lookout for potential collaborations and opportunities for growth. The idea of acquiring contact information from over 120K distinct companies that utilize AddThis definitely piques my interest.

I appreciate the attached sample file for review. It will give me a better understanding of the quality and relevance of the contacts you have available. It's important for me to ensure that the data meets our criteria and aligns with our target audience.

Now, let's talk about the pricing. I see that you have a scale-down pricing model based on the number of contacts acquired. It's quite fascinating how the cost-per-contact decreases as the number of records increases. I would like to explore the possibility of acquiring a test file of 1K contacts at $149. This will allow me to assess the value and fit of the data before committing to a larger purchase.

If you could provide me with a quote, along with the terms and conditions, I would greatly appreciate it. It's essential for me to fully understand the extent of the agreement and to ensure that it aligns with our business objectives.

Thank you again for your offer and your patience in answering my questions. I genuinely believe there might be potential in this collaboration, and I'm excited to take the next steps.

Best regards,

Stavros
Founder, Stochastic Technologies
