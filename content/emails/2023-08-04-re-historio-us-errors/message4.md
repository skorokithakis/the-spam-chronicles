Hi Arbin,

Thanks for sharing the examples of websites you have previously worked on. It's helpful to see the keywords and their rankings on Google. The results you achieved for those websites are impressive, and it gives me confidence in your capabilities.

Regarding determining the most effective keywords for my business, I appreciate that you will suggest the best keywords during the campaign. It's important to have input and approval from me before proceeding.

I'm glad to hear that you focus on 100% manual submissions for off-page optimization. Permanent backlinks generated through manual submissions can definitely contribute to improving my website's ranking. The list of off-page activities you provided, such as classified ads posting, directory listing, search engine submission, and blog commenting, seems thorough and diverse.

Your guarantee to rank my website on the first page of Google is reassuring. Monthly performance reports will help me track the progress and understand the detailed work activities you perform.

At this stage, I feel that I have a good understanding of your services and approach. I would like to proceed with the next step. Please let me know what information or materials you need from me and how we can initiate the campaign.

Thank you for your continued assistance and prompt communication.

Best regards,

Stavros
