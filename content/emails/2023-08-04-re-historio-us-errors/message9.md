Hi Stavros,
Thank you!

The mentioned invoice link is for PayPal. Once you go to the payment 
then it redirects to the PayPal page to make the payment.

Once you're made the payment, we will send you a paid invoice for your 
reference.

Also, the earlier payment link is working. Here is the 
link@https://www.inbuiltsoft.com/customize-plan/
<https://www.inbuiltsoft.com/customize-plan/>

If you want to pay with card then we have the other payment option to 
pay with credit/debit card.

Let me know.

Regards,

I've followed the new link you shared, but it seems to redirect me to the PayPal homepage instead of a specific invoice page. It's possible that there might be an error with the link or a technical issue on the PayPal website.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide an updated and direct link to the specific invoice associated with my payment. Once I have the correct link, I will proceed with the payment and promptly provide you with the confirmation.
