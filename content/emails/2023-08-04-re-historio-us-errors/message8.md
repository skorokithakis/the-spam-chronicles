Hi Arbin,

Thank you for providing the invoice link. I apologize for the confusion earlier. I've followed the new link you shared, but it seems to redirect me to the PayPal homepage instead of a specific invoice page. It's possible that there might be an error with the link or a technical issue on the PayPal website.

To ensure a smooth payment process, could you please verify the invoice link one more time? It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide an updated and direct link to the specific invoice associated with my payment. Once I have the correct link, I will proceed with the payment and promptly provide you with the confirmation.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to resolving this matter soon.

Best regards,

Stavros
