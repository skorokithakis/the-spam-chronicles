Hi Arbin,

Thank you for providing the payment process to get started with the campaign. I appreciate your efficiency in this matter. However, I seem to be encountering some issues with the payment link you shared. I followed the link but couldn't find the option to enter the amount. It seems there might be a technical glitch on the webpage.

Could you please double-check the payment link and ensure that it is working correctly? I'm eager to proceed with the payment and move forward with the campaign. Once the issue is resolved, I'll make the payment and provide you with the confirmation as requested.

Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Stavros
