Hi Arbin,

I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a mistake in providing you with my WhatsApp number. I appreciate your patience in this matter.

Please use the following WhatsApp number to reach me: +30 XXXXXXXXXX. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous incorrect number. 

Once you have added this number to your contacts, please let me know, and I will resend the message with my account details and an overview of the payment issue. I understand how important it is to address this matter promptly, and I am committed to resolving it.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,

Stavros
