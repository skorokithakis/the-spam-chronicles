Hi Arbin,

Thank you for your understanding and support. I appreciate your patience as I work on resolving the technical issues with the payment links.

I have made the payment using the PayPal link you provided. Once the payment has been successfully processed, I kindly request that you send me the paid invoice for my reference. It will be helpful to have the invoice as proof of payment and for keeping track of our transaction.

Regarding the earlier payment link, I am still experiencing difficulties accessing it. I have checked my internet connection and tried different browsers, but the issue persists. I will continue troubleshooting and exploring alternative solutions to resolve this matter. I will provide you with an update as soon as possible.

Thank you again for your assistance and understanding. I look forward to receiving the paid invoice and resolving the payment issue soon.

Best regards,

Stavros
