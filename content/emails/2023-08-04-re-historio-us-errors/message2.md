Hi Arbin,

Thank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your offer to help with my website's SEO. It's great to see that you offer a comprehensive approach to improving visibility and driving potential traffic.

I went through the activities you mentioned, and they all seem relevant and beneficial. Fixing technical errors, conducting an in-depth study of my website and competition, determining search engine friendliness, selecting relevant keywords, on-page optimization, link building - it's exactly what I need for my business.

Your proposal looks interesting as well. The customized plan with 14 targeted keywords, 60 allocated hours per month, and bi-weekly/monthly reporting sounds like a comprehensive package. It's good to know that there are no contract or locking periods.

The results you mentioned, such as fixing on-page issues and appearing on the first page of Google, are definitely desirable outcomes for me.

I do have a few questions:

1. Can you provide some examples of the websites you have previously worked on and their results?
2. How do you determine which keywords are most effective for my business?
3. Can you share more details about the off-page optimization techniques you use?
4. Is there any guarantee on the results you mentioned, like the website appearing on the first page of Google?

I look forward to your response and further discussing how we can proceed.

Best regards,

Stavros
