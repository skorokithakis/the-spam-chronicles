Hi Arbin,

Thank you for clarifying. I apologize for the confusion regarding the invoice link. I understand now that the link is for PayPal, and it will redirect me to the PayPal page to make the payment.

In that case, I will proceed with the payment using the PayPal link you provided. I will make sure to enter the correct amount and complete the payment. Once the payment is successfully processed, I kindly request that you send me the paid invoice for my reference.

Regarding the earlier payment link, thank you for confirming that it is working. However, I still seem to encounter some technical issues when trying to access it. It could be an internal issue on my end, so I will troubleshoot further to see if I can resolve it.

If I encounter any further difficulties, I will let you know and explore the alternative payment option with a credit/debit card.

Thank you for your patience and assistance in this matter.

Best regards,

Stavros
