Hi Arbin,

Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your assistance in resolving the payment issue.

I have tried accessing the new payment link you shared, but unfortunately, I am still experiencing difficulties. It seems that the issue is not specific to a particular payment link, but rather a general technical issue on my end. I apologize for the inconvenience.

To further troubleshoot, I have tried clearing cache and cookies, as well as using a different device. However, I am still unable to access the payment page. At this point, I kindly request your understanding and cooperation as I continue to explore alternative methods or solutions to resolve this matter.

If you have any other payment options available, please do share them with me. I am more than willing to try different options to ensure the successful completion of the payment.

Thank you once again for your patience and support. I apologize for any delays caused by these technical difficulties, and I appreciate your assistance in finding a suitable resolution.

Looking forward to your guidance and further suggestions.

Best regards,

Stavros
