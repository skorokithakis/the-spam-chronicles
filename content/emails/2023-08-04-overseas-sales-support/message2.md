Hi Martin,

Thanks for reaching out! I appreciate your interest in our work in overseas markets. As for a reliable translation partner, we have been exploring different options lately. Your services at Verboo certainly sound intriguing.

You mentioned the combination of AI and human touch in localization, which seems quite innovative. I would be interested in learning more about how your approach can help us achieve cost-effective localization without compromising quality. Can you provide me with some examples or case studies?

Also, it would be helpful to know more about the range of language services your network of professionals offers. Could you please provide me with more details on that?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Stavros
