Hey Jai,

Thanks for getting back to me and providing an updated meeting link. I appreciate your efforts in rectifying the technical issue with the previous link.

Now, when I click on the new meeting link you shared, it seems to be working fine. However, I'm currently experiencing some difficulties with accepting calendar invites due to a technical issue on my end. Is it possible for us to continue our discussion via email or another communication channel? That way, we can still have a smooth and productive conversation without any hitches caused by the calendar invite.

I'm excited to share my specific questions and ideas with you and explore the advanced platforms that can seamlessly integrate with my website, stochastic.io.

In the meantime, if you could provide me with your contact details so we can communicate directly, that would be great. That way, we can maintain a strong connection and avoid any potential disconnections.

I'm looking forward to hearing more about your insights and discussing how we can enhance the performance and user experience of my website.

Thank you again for reaching out, and let's keep in touch!

Best regards,
Stavros
