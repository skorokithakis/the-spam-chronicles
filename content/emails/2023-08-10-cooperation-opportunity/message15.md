After reviewing your comment, I would need to clarify the following.

1. In the introduction, please mention my software development agency,
Stochastic Technologies, and highlight our expertise in the industry.

Do you mean to highlight your expertise in the industry of Redstore backup
software? Or do you mean some other software?

Could you describe in more detail what kind of programming skill we should
describe in the article?
Thanks.
