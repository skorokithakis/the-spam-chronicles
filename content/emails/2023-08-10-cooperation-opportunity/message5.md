Sure, let's discuss them. So, what about these questions:

- Could you provide some guidelines or a specific outline for the article?
- *We can write some like of these topics *
*"Reasons to Use Backups for Trello in Your Business"*

*"How to Build a Jira Cloud backup strategy"*
*"Tips to Back Up Your Trello Data"*

Or we can talk about your preferences on this topic.

- Additionally, could you let me know if the article will be exclusively
published on my website or if it will be shared elsewhere? - *The article
will be created by our writer's team and exclusively published only on your
website. *

- Lastly, I would like to confirm the timeline for completion and payment
arrangements. - *We prefer payment after publishing the article (asap, or
max to 2 days if this will be a weekend), but also we can make the payment
in advance - via an invoice (if it is PayPal method)  or payment request
(if it is Paoneer wallet).*

Thank you.
