Hi, Stavros,
I hope you have a good day;) Sorry for the delayed reply, but now I found
out that's project's plan monthly is closed.

So, also I can propose you https://www.backupvault.co.uk/ on the topic
"Redstor cloud backup solutions".

What about the time: how about next week, I think, on Friday? If on Friday
can you publish it by the end of this month? Or is it better for you, then
can we do it next month? Or, please tell us when we need to send it to you
so that it is ready by the end of the month.
Thank you.
