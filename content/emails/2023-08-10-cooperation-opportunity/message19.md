In response to your mail, firstly, I apologize for this misunderstanding of
what arose in our transaction, but according to our last correspondence, it
became clear to us that your services are not what we are looking for.

When we pay for the placement of an article, we usually receive an article
about our services and we do not study and focus on external services and
companies.

I'm sorry for the time both sides have wasted, but we can't work.

All the best, Stavros!
