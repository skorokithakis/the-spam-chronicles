Hi Alice,

Thank you for holding the collaboration spot for StavrosAI. I'm excited to move forward with the next steps.

Regarding the major features to be showcased, I can provide you with the necessary information. However, it would be great if you could source the information yourself via StavrosAI's website. It will ensure that you have access to the most accurate and up-to-date details.

For the social media handles to be tagged, please use the following:

Instagram: @stavrosai
Twitter: @stavrosai

As for the link to be included in your bio, please use our affiliate link: [insert your preferred affiliate link here].

I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing the draft video script within 24 hours after payment and talking points are received. Once we're satisfied with the script, we can proceed with filming the video. As for the posting date, do you have any specific suggestions or recommendations for when would be the best time to reach the maximum audience?

To secure the collaboration, I'll proceed with the payment via Stripe. I will follow the link you provided and toggle the quantity accordingly.

Thank you for all your help, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in bringing this collaboration to life!

Talk soon.

Best regards,
Stavros
