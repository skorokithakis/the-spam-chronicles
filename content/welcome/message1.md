Hello! I'm Stavros, welcome to the Spam Chronicles.

Years ago, I created [Spamnesty](https://spa.mnesty.com/). Spamnesty let you forward
your spam to it, and it would reply to spammers with pre-written messages, wasting their
time and (hopefully) resulting in entertaining conversations.

Much, much later, ChatGPT came out, and its impact on messing with spammers was obvious.
Unfortunately, I couldn't really integrate it into Spamnesty for two reasons: One was
that of cost, as it would get very expensive very quickly to have to generate thousands
of responses per day. The other was simply that most spam today is automated, so it
would just be bots talking to bots, which doesn't make for entertaining conversation.

Still, this idea was on the back of my mind, and when one day I got a spam message from
someone trying to sell me some services, I thought "well, this is an actual person, and
I could waste their time by having ChatGPT generate a reply that comes from my own
inbox."

A day later, I had made [SpamGPT](https://github.com/skorokithakis/spamgpt), a small
script that would look at a certain label in my mailbox, and have ChatGPT reply to
emails with that label. That way, whenever I got a spam email that looked like it came
from a person, I could just apply the `SpamGPT` label to it and the script would handle
the rest.

Seeing how the conversations were lots of fun to read, I figured I shouldn't keep them
to myself, so I created this site for you to share in my mirth.

Without further do, you can see the conversations by clicking the "The Conversations"
link on the sidebar, or here:
